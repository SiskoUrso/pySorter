# pySorter

I needed something to help me sort out my Downloads folders which is very similar across all my machines. So always looking for small projects to automate right now I made this to make it easy. 

Quick breakdown is it lists all the files in the directory, creates lists based on the filetypes, loops run through and sorts out the files to directories and creates the directory if it does not exists. Adds the files sorted to a dictionary when then is looped through and put into another dictionary that is looped through and a summary is created with a break down of how many files moved and what category they fit in and the files moved.
